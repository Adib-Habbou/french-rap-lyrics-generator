Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Should I stay sober until the end?
Should I get wasted until my mind's erased?
Even though reality gon' slap me straight
It's hand might break got too many things in my head, my head!
Should I make a song, or should I make three more
Should I be the best, or should I be the one
Should I stand still, or should I, should I run
My left hand got the keys, but the other got a gun
Should I feel a doubt when I'm watching the news
Should I fuck with industry or should I refuse
Should I tell everybody I love, "I love you"
Should I wake my problems up or should I hit snooze
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Do I really need to fuck her now?
My mind's tricking my body on Negrita
I know what I gotta do to make her cry
Should I stay tonight, or should I say goodbye, goodbye
Should I love this girl? no I won't even try
Should I feel ashamed? no, but should I feel proud
Would I be the same if I wasn't that high, nigga
Should I be earthbounded when my head's in the sky
Should I be generous if I wanna be liked
Should I be omnipresent to keep up this psych
Should I be the first, or should I be the last one
Should I fuck up the game, or should I win this fight..
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
There will be highs, and lows... thank God I remain ok
How can I prove them how hourglasses drive me insane
And I'm amazed, when I think about how lucky I am
Not to wake up in a country full of bombings
Killings, 'side of them I got no fucking problems
Glad you never tried to put me down
Oh too many times I did you wrong
Diggin' in my inner me
, then I found the enemies, how the fuck them niggas were too strong
And I kept those diamonds in my mind too long, no, they don't believe me 'cause I look too young
Keen everytime I see the beauty, bitter taste coming too quickly 'cause I'm always looking for what's wrong
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and
I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Survive...
Survive...
Survive...
Thank God I was dead, I came back three years ago
Body in the air, like they say it in these shows
You put me back in it, just to teach them what I know
Then I'll have to go
I gotta go, and see, all the shit that was in my mind
Thank God I do not live where Trump came after Obama
All my strength for the mamacitas, my brothers, sisters, never give up
Beginning of a new world that nobody wants, believe it or not I still do trust in us now
Yeah I know, I know, I know
Rose got thorns and I got a long way to go
Plus I told ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
No matter what happens we're never down, down, downI came in this game like a motherfuckin' rat
Like I was starving for things I never thought I could have
I gave you all I got! Now you talk behind my back?
I ain't a time-philantropist anymore, what ?
You came to me like a little child
I brought you up, fed you and gave you all of my time
I taught you all I learned, lended you what I earned
Without me nah you ain't even a piece of shit, you turd
Yesterday we were brothers
Oh now we're enemies!
Understand I'm no longer
Numb and my time ain't free
Yesterday we were brothers
Oh now we're enemies!
Understand "fuck your eager"
Yeah you been too greedy
You don't know shit about how to start the game
Not the same level, struggle, sacrifices, pain
Ayo! Ain't no questioning about who is the best
You better not test, I am Gatsby, you're the guest. YES
Wanna snatch my dreams
Imma be your worst nightmare, yeah
Don't play with fire
Holy water's in my hands
And I don't care if you do, you don't, distinguish what I'm saying
Many meanings in my texts but I swear this shit no fiction
I wrote these lines cuz it releaved a big part of my pain
It will never be the same, nigga I will still be yelling!
Yesterday we were brothers
Oh now we're enemies!
Understand I'm no longer
Numb and my time ain't free
Yesterday we were brothers
Oh now we're enemies!
Understand "fuck your eager"
Yeah you been too greedyI do it for my dad and I do it for my mama
I do it for my shabs and I do it for my sistas
I do it for my city and I don't forget Africa
I do it for my hoes, my thugs, my bitches, my gangstas
I do it for the best, how could I forget my haters?
And I do it for my uncles they told me : "da fuck you doing here?
Better have you degrees, masters!" Thinking that I go nowhere
But I don't wanna be no one, been working like a Trojan, man!
I know, you know, we know, Rilès is not the only one, yay
By myself I don't need your prod
I don't want your beef, your bitch and your buzz, always for my bros, my niggas, my blood
Never for the fuzz, they shootin' my cuz, I wanna bring the peace, but can I be bad?
This shit is for me, for you and for us, I do it for the streets, and for the suburbs
Plus I do it for the passion and I do it for the patience
No I'll never forget the pain from this fight
I do it for my family, I do it for my family
I do it for my family, that's why
Why o why? Why o why you ask?
I do it for my mama, why you take aback?
Ohh, why o why? Why o why you ask?
I do it for my baba for his sacrifice
Why o why? Why o why you ask?
I do it for my

Hmm, why o why? Why o why you ask?
As we're about to build and you're about to crack..
.. Ok, ok, ok, ok you do it for your family and shit, that's cool
But don't tell me you don't do it for money bruh
I don't fuck with their money and once I got some it's for granny
Buy a plane for my niggas, we leave for Mexico city
For now we ain't rico tony, be wise chico ain't no worry
Time is money so we hurry,
akhi bzef I'm too busy
Yay, brother, brother, brother
Don't call 911, I'm about to spread that fire
Halle-halle-lujah, tell me you see me now
We've been hidden too long, you know, we've never seen the sunRilès you're arrogant
You lift yourself up, you believed in your craft when nobody did
But we say arrogant
You dont know the game, you keep mentionning my name, "We dont like what you s-"

Jay-Z's label on the phone, they're coming at the house on Monday

wow, wow, great, great
, don't say too much they're gonna see what's next
They're hating on me cuz they ain't done shit, I'll forgive you cuz y'all giving me strengh
Say

They all want me dead, I piss them off, that's what I like to
You're sending me death threats in my mailbox, Mama we gon' move
Talk to me 'fore your talk 'bout me, yeah that's the number 1 rule
Many want my head, but where's the crown? It's on my balls fool!
Wow, wow, great, great
Don't show them that you've been loving yourself
Say you're ugly, say you're not the best, don't pump yourself up, they don't like them speeches
Wow, wow, great, great
I do not go downtown
I'm feeling like hate and love are fighting for my vehemence
Now I got girls who want my d*** and crazy dudes who want my head
Wait...History repeats itself
With the blood and with the hate
I don’t like to see that face
When you say once again
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
History repeats itself
With the blood and with the hate
I don’t like to see that face
When you say once again
I finessed the proof
And it’s the truth
Your try for peace is just a vain
Attempt to dilute the hate, the rage, the pain, the pill
The people track & try to cheat
Cuz I traveled all around the fear
Defended flaws and feels
Followed the foolish way
Now freedom’s so dumb
I don’t believe in nothing but the bitter taste of yesterday
Yeah the hopeless song
Is swiping strong
Cuz nothing changed
And nothing won’t
We think we care
Indeed we don’t
We gon’ forget and swap the same mistake
‘em dollars, add them genres
Races, religions
Perks and burdens
Pride to worsen
Worships, words to dust
And there’s the world I’m watchin'Hey, hey, hey, hey
Listen.. you're too crazy nigga
You better stop now
You better stop..
Let me tell you something;
When you dive into the wild
You can find death, you can find love
Better think about it twice
Cuz we all think, you gon' be gone
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
I'm 'bout to turn up every city
I do it for the real ones, real shit, real maafaka, hun
Lost 15lbs since the Rilèsundayz
Before I live like a king, gotta work like a slave
For the music, way, never lost, nah
Couple of months, Rilès on tour, yah
King in my city, ain't no debate now
Let me wipe all the bullshit they all left on the side
And I bounce when I feel it, master it then, done
I ain't from Miami, I ain't from the Westside
Coming from
R-city
, headed up to the Jungle
And you still think I'm mad..
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the JungleListen up, you got a
problem
man
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time
Lotta pressure on my name
Lotta worries in my head
Lotta responsibilities, traps & threats
I canalize, no I won’t break
Down at night alone with myself
With my demons and my pain
Maybe if I blow some trees and see that bitch it’ll make all that shit fade away
Don’t get distracted
Pleasure is not happiness, stop running away from reality
Baby you’ve been on my mind
So let me smoke
Weed every night
Last night I gave up and did it again
I tricked my mind to forget
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my timeI spent
One entire week without any rest
Without getting out of my room I know it’s all in the head
Always perfecting my craft
I’m not that far from the best
I understood the more you do
The better you know yourself
I understood the mind is bigger than the whole universe
I understood I was afraid of failure, ‘till I got hurt
I understood that being rich was more of a state of mind
And I won’t ever be happy with money, ‘till it buys time
Aside of that, everything marvelous
I level up, more follow us
They fear me now I’m lifting up
You’re hating when they’re loving us
Family first, I still assert
No fraud involved in none of us
I already knew that before the wave was taking off
And Imma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I'll take off
I don’t trust nobody cuz my body’s enough
Really understood a lot from the last several months
Imma imma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I’ll take off
Not feeling impressed by millions anymore
Really understood a lot from the last several months
Don’t ever, ever leave your door opened
Weird niggas tried breaking in and steal at fucking 3 A.M
Gotta protect Mom and my sister before they face a gun
I met death twice
Don’t worry I can meet it again
Don’t ever ever let somebody say
“You can't make a music video without a damn budget”
‘Brothers’, 40$
10 million and zero marketing
Yes I came in this game like a motherfucking rat I said
Don’t ever give a fuck about cats on the internet
Starving for attention but your screen is not paying your bills
You work at a shitty job and your gently hating yourself
So when you go back home
Holler at me if it cuts your pain
But the best I understood
Was I don’t need validation
I’ve been waiting for them blogs
‘Till I found out it’s all made up
Negotiating everything
Paying for a piece of paper?
Making waves in my country
Yet I still got 0 portrait
Something you should know
And I got examples
Everybody was surprised after
SEB’s support
I had 50 songs out and music videos
And everybody was like
“Why I never heard ‘bout you?”
Man..5 A.M
Parking lot
Looking like "damn"
Got the honey, got the weed
And got all my problems
Acting like people i'm sick of
Talking like people i blame
Seems like you're thinking too much
Too much to forget it's a game
Too much to forget love's around
So you let go all the praise
And you're diving in some pussies
Just to forget that you sink
Boy you thought you knew yourself
But you've been skipping chapters
Don't ever claim that you're the boss
When you're just act like a loser
HAA
Liquor got me out of touch
I'm falling off, don't catch me up
Ain't no bitches, ain't no girls
Tonight depression is my crush
Tell'em I was on the road
Seeking happiness
I lost
Reason when i understood
Glory's not replacing love
Hope is not replacing trust
Y'all is not replacing us
Peace won't ever make a buzz
So we all keep on watching Trump
Feeling love but moving up
Ain't nobody gonna beat it, wish me luck
Better kill it cuz I'm on the highest drugs
Talking 'bout this psyche looking at me bruh
My love, my lust
My liquor for the pain
It is Me vs. Me
And i forfeit the game
Shit i act
I think
As if i'm twice my age
But good news
I don't give a fuck
If y'all niggas don't give a damn
x2
All those nights you're losing your grip
All those nights you can't fall asleep
All those nights you just want to quit
God I need to run
Before I hit the bang bang
Keep on running, ask no questions
Keep on running, same directions
You're not lost, you're just incaged
You've been running all night
Now you see the day
"WAKE UP"Baby don't lie
Talk the talk, never act
Who the fuck you thought I was?
You dared to fool me twice
Baby don't lie
Talk the talk, never act
Who the fuck you thought I was?
You dared to fool me twice
Rilès maafaka in this game right now
And you won't believe what the hell I see right now
Seems like everybody is pretty fake right now
If you're not into a label you don't count right now
Fuck I don't want to believe what I say right now
I might never blow up cuz of what I say right? nah
Most of the shit you hear is pretty wack right now
Yes I'm only 20 they're afraid of me, don't ya?
Fuck your talent
We don't wanna fuck with ya
If you don't have no money to pay a press officer
Yeah you buy articles
That's how it goes
If y'already famous then we'll be all on your toes, and you say..
Baby don't lie
Talk the talk, never act
Who the fuck you thought I was?
You dared to fool me twice
Baby don't lie
Talk the talk, never act
Who the fuck you thought I was?
You dared to fool me twice
Independent who minds about you, if you deserve
Ten times better than any motherfuckin' pseudo 'come-up'
Cuz I feel like many medias tried to fuck my game up
Oh, when I played them "I Do It" a year ago they were pumped
She told me: "Oh my God I love the song, I want that shit first
I can send it to blogs, and this and that, and.." Shut the fuck up
We know you did your trick
We sent the vid
You don't respond
Oh, bsa7tek la clique
Yeah I studied English, stupid niggas, what you thought?
I gettin' really ready for the shit that you're not
It's been five years in the making and I will never stop
So never mind if I don't please to mister Boukercha
Writing classics or riding dicks, I think my choice is made
I'm fucking pissed and tired of sending all those god damn mails
"Hello my name is Rilès, 20 years old self made man
I make my beats, record my raps.."
And we don't fucking care
So keep on surfing the wave but do not ignore the storm
Don't even stutter to me when I'll get my Grammy's on
When I'll be overplayed and overheard like Bruno's songs
It might take ten motherfucking years I'll prove'em wrong
Shit I'm bitter with the time
Better with the flow
You poppin' up right now you don't know how to make a song
And I'm bitter with the time
Better with the flow
You poppin' up right now, you don't how you made it now, hun? x2
"Hello Rilès, how you doin' now?
I'm not used to calling you
Feels like we need to talk
I went through your latest lines
And saw suicide
Tell me that I'm wrong
Don't tell me I am fucking right"
I said "I'm alive"
I'm alive
I'm alive
Even when I'm weak I told you it's gon' be alright
Read it better
Though you might read it well
Silence is killing me
I resurrect
Those who really know me
Know I got strength
Mind of a Shaolin
Shapen in steel
Ouhhhh
They don't want to play my shit
They don't want to see me win
Bouwhouwhouwhou
You're thinking that makes me sick?
To the point I'd kill myself?
"Hello Rilès, how you doin' now?
I'm not used to calling you
Feels like we need to talk
I went through your latest lines
And saw suicide
Tell me that I'm wrong
Don't tell me I am fucking right"
I said "I'm alive"
I'm alive
I'm alive
Even when I'm weak I told you it's gon' be alrightMan I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time’s always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's
the 3ein
on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
Nah I don’t know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
And I don't know what the fuck's so wrong
Wasn't ready for the downfall on my own
Should've never talked about it in my songs
You’re solo when you’re so low, so everything slows down
I'm here and there no I never stay
In the stud, I should’ve been today
Why the fuck got the cam in my hand?
I do your job cuz you cannot do shit
And it's like;
“Wow” everywhere I go
“Don't make them videos
You waste your force, use it for your flow
Your music and your shows”
But listen bro, I cannot trust yo
Yo lazy motherfuck, I needed help
No pesos, you made it clear my problems ain't yours
Nah I don’t know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
Lost and Found then
Many traps on my way
I've been escaping the desert
Not my faithMike Mixer is in the bulding
Ooh la, la Shaz

You like it low key
Bellek aux losas 
In the fine line 
Rolling with the clique we like the fine ones 
With the style, style 
She like gentlemen and not the Weinsteins, ayy
Uno, dos, tres, quatro
Tell her "Shawty meet me at the Montecarlo"
Gave her flowers, ten grams
Feel like Pablo
I been pushing weight
Just to try to know you
Hyped up, smoking in the street like it's legal
Hyped up, bitches on my thumb like I'm Scott Storch
Hyped up, get the fuck out of Hell no more sad songs
Fall up, welcome to the jungleI don’t want to mess up all my vibes
Oh you’d like to stay inside
But now I got to pick a side, hey
You was all around the lows for me
I don’t need to chase you here
I try to leave the beast in me
No you ain’t
Saving me from outter stress
No you won’t
Try to take another chance
No I ain’t
Giving you a thousand reasons no more
No you ain’t
Saving me from my own self
No you won’t
Handle my needs when I can’t
No I ain’t
Giving you a thousand reasons no more
Now that all that shit’s behind me
As I chose to swim and not sink
I cannot destroy what I built all along
Try to be one with my thoughts
Try to get back self love
It’s me or you never us
Try to find back what I need
Thеn what I want will lead
I’m sure that’s how we hеal
No you ain’t
Saving me from outter stress
No you won’t
Try to take another chance
No I ain’t
Giving you a thousand reasons no more
No you ain’t
Saving me from my own self
No you won’t
Handle my needs when I can’t
No I ain’t
Giving you a thousand reasons no more
Now that all that shit’s behind me
As I chose to swim and not sink
I cannot destroy what I built all alongI ain’t got no one to fear
I ain’t impressed anymore
I don’t see but I feel
Sour energy brought me there
Search into you and the paper’s gon fill up itself
So fuck if you curse when I flex
Fuck I’m not kind and stupid, better serve me respect
I think I’m good at feeling bad
Don’t be too nice when scavengers are ready to bounce
I picture plans in my head
Darker than
Dinka
Venom pushing up my edges
I won’t let dirt on my name
Do it for fun
‘Front of me bitch you bargain
I ain’t got a lot to sing
Still alive just for the hate that I hate, bitch
You gon’ remember the name
Jungle ain’t shit when you’re beaten all over again
Smoking the shine in my eyes and I’m left with some apeshit Enlighten but thoughts are the darkest
Wildin’ everywhere but in the jungle

Rilesundayz finally grows
Been 2 years in a row
Yea patience was the key
And now we kicking with the pros
Yea I'm coming I'm, coming
Dive or run and I'm running
Never gone if I'm leaving-
Keep on going if I go away
Bitches n yamz

Ser to my sins
Lotta despair
Many mistakes
In my defence
Skippin' that love
As if it was hitting my legsI swear to God
I can do it again
Living on better days
I don’t have further choice
I swear on me
I won’t dive in my sins
I will quiet my thoughts
Simply walk on my own
Working late night, scared of tomorrow
Tell me how does it feel not to struggle
If it’s a matter of peace, where do I go
Take all of my money, if it shuts down
All of this voice in my head
Why they here for
If cannot just blow’em off
How do they go?
Trynna live a little long’, for the love now
I need to try
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It’s the life that I was choosing
And I try, I try, I try, I try again
Every time to fall back on it
Now I ride, alone and late at night for hours
To distract the evil in me
'Cause I can’t let me down anymore
I swear to God
I can do it again
Living on better days
I don’t have further choice
I swear on me
I won’t dive in my sins
I will quiet my thoughts
Simply walk on my own
What you got?
Sick again?
Take a pause
You don’t like it, just get it
You should matter, understand it
Evolutionning and
You should mean it
Ain’t a gimmick
I got us a problem
Now you work it
Don’t escape it
But how could I really believe, a yema
How could I say what I feel, a yema

We supply
Pay the dues
Feed the fam
We done crashed
Then got up
And again
And the problems
And the samples
And the bills
And the friends
You keep on trying
You is a lion
But you been dying
Ever since they got you signed
Need acceptance from no one
Just need my wife
I said I'm right
But inside I'm feeling spines
Oh baby I'm falling
Falling for the run
Run and try to catch the sun
Oh baby I'm falling
Falling on and on
Wasn't that wrong hmmhmWhat I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I’m shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream
Solitary on a Friday
Starving now I need some peaches
Hmhmhm
Looking in the cards I flip
Nothing really find for me
Hmhmhmhm
Maybe I am not that hungry
Maybe it’s a trap full of lust and envy
I won't fall in it
Rilès you already did
Put the phone down
Open reason
Go for a run
But please do not touch and smoke your drogas, drogas
I'm too weak so I roll a big one, big one
Then I trip and I keep on scrollin down, scroll down
I say "bye my ethic" I'm so dumb, so dumb, hun
She pick up the phone
I pick up my weed
And my lust
And my greed
And the others sins
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna feel
Not aware of tonight's true insanity
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can’t even find my words
This is it
You’re just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream
Knock knock
"Who's there?"
"It’s the
Sheitan
motherfucker let's play"
She already naked
And she feeling really really thirsty wow
Looking like a model nothing like them hoes
Waking up the savage in me, can't control
Let me put all of my pain down in your pussy
With my pace I wish you will endure like nobody did
Ouh, damn
She a savage
Pull on her horns like she was the villain
And we fucking and banging and banging and fucking and fucking and fucking and banging and fucking like
Wow!

Was it fake or was it real ? 
She feeling like I’m a star
She feeling my energyÉ a verdade que me leva
É a verdade que me leva
Perdoa minha alma, meu amor
Na 'scuridão ainda eu 'tou
É a verdade que me leva
É a verdade que me leva
Perdoa minha alma, meu amor
De fingir me desanimou
Andalé, Andalé
Sun slowly slept away
Didn't have nowhere to go but down
That life wasn't up to me
I wish being sad was just a trend I wish I could start again
I wish on the inside would be more than just a man
É a verdade que me leva
É a verdade que me leva
Perdoa minha alma, meu amor
Na 'scuridão ainda eu 'touDarling, I’m not falling
I'ma hold it down for us
Ain’t nothing much
Darling, I’m not falling
Trynna get my self back to me
Oh baby, please
Get it back or deal with nothing
Yeah, it’s hurting but I love it
I been dealing with my demons
Back in time, I wasn't decent
Living life felt like a prison
Get it back or deal with nothing
Yeah, it’s hurting, I don’t hate it
It was like me versus lord
Versus jinx, versus now
Shit, I really I did it wrong
Oh, darling, I’m not falling
I'ma hold it down for us
Ain’t nothing much
Darling, I’m not falling
Trynna get my self back to me
Oh baby, please
Sometimes I feel like I really do me wrong
Sometimes I feel like I better never know
Sometimes I feel like I see what else to feel
'Till I go back in the pleasure of a sin
And I know it’s like I'm always in a rush
But if I don’t run, I can’t afford to crumble
What you need, I’m here for
Matter of fact, I want you back, is what I feel
Matter of fact, I want you bad, just for my needs
I know I've been way too selfish, darling
Look my love ain’t like a promise, darling
Reminding, too wild and her starving
Was a pretty start then
Too easy to break it
I need us to collect the piecesShe said 'I still love you'
I still send you letters
I'm not reading your words
So why you love me better?
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you flowers
But the perfume I knew
Now don't really matter
Don't wanna be friends tho
After all the shit I did along the line
Just wanna be real now 
Was a poison for you with the sweetest lies
I just wanna be real now
You were the first with the real love
But I torn it up
And ruined it like I wanted
Yeah I lied to you and me
Rose
The petal and the moth
The victim and the cause
I did my best to do the worst
And repeat when you're
Gone
Close and yet alone
Love or just a joke
I cannot feel more wrong
When I see sequels
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you letters
I'm not reading your words
So why you love me better
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you flowers
But the perfume I knew
Know don't really matter
Trust my sense
I can feel your self
I don't want your sex
I just want, you, sane
Keep on lyin'
And with no regrets
Messin with the fakes
In a year you dead, ohBlood on my lips I'm so hungry I'm 'bout to kill them all
Tears on your cheek, bitch you thristy and I'm your waterfall
Street is the shit, you can't escape so we had to got balls
Don't even speak your language, still got more bars
Don't need to sell your shit to prove who's the boss
I'm fighting everyday you can see on my arms
Capoeira, pancrase, with no gun bitch you done
Grandpa's a warrior, I got that on my bones
Today I may chill with you, tomorrow you done
Today I may be unknown, tomorrow I'm on
Now many motherfuckers starving to be known
You ain't even spit a verse, I already won
Nowadays white motherfuckers at the top
Nowadays niggas want to get out the block
Nowadays all of my rebeus wanna rap
And I'm sitting here ready to burn them up, hun
Nowadays white motherfuckers at the top
Nowadays niggas want to get out the block
Nowadays all of my rebeus wanna rap
And I'm sitting here ready to burn them up, hun
Now, who's the realest?
Now, where're the killers?
Now, who's the baddest?
No, we ain't modest
To this street credibility,you can't find no democracy
But we use our abilities to get out of this misery
Bitch, you know my name
But you don't know my mind, my history
I came in this game, I was well trained
My mom in hysteria
We are so scary that at first sight I beat the shit of you
Don't even speak your language I'm before every move you do
Every move you do, every, every move you do
Every move you do, every fucking move you do!I’ve been running to the side
On the streets with my woes
I’ve been all around the jinx alone
In the midst of it all
I’ve been running to the side
On the streets with my woes
I’ve been all around the jinx
If a
3ein
is a gift
I’ve been running from myself
I was smart, I had a plan
But never thought I could've break it down
Never thought I could've died
I’ve been brought through spaceship
And my thoughts out of stone
Never looked at what I did to me
Never thought of what could’ve been done
Never thought of what I did to me
Lost in me
Tough and alone
Couldn’t face what I did to sh-
And I paid for the price on the low
I’ve been running to the side
On the streets with my woes
I’ve been all around the jinx alone
In the midst of it all
I’ve been running to the side
On the streets with my woes
I’ve been all around the jinx
If a 3ein is a gift
Never fronting, chasing fame and friendships
Pardon me if my love's on the wrong side
Since I saw them faking preachings
Just to get on the front
I’ve been pumped for shit
They got tox’ on their tongue
I’m accustomed to the minimum
I don’t want nothing more
Never blaming my faults
Sat on my pain
I don’t want fame
But shit it’s like I still love it
I want you bad
I’m ready for getting back on my ownThe Evil tried to tear me down
Oh lord you saw me on the ground
The Evil tried to tear me down
8 weeks ago death on my mind
The Evil tried to tear me down
Oh lord you saw me on the ground
The Evil tried to tear me down
But it was just written in Time
*Knock, Knock* Who's there? It's the
sheitan
motherfucker let's play
Sorry bruh I ain't got time for your tricks now, I got all my people listening now
4 years in the shadow they were blind out, I thought I would never see the light bruh
Now you can finally wake the fuck up, Rachid, Laura, tell me how you feel now
Always chasing you for just a paper, got love for you but you could've been first
Pushed me to the edge but never gave up, 'least I learned to never ever trust Trust
I can feel the change is real, I can feel you won't be me
I can feel these niggas 'round me, just want to be famous, still looking for their skils

Thanks to y'all I did not jumped off
The Evil tried to tear me down
Oh lord you saw me on the ground
The Evil tried to tear me down
8 weeks ago death on my mind
The Evil tried to tear me down
Oh lord you saw me on the ground
The Evil tried to tear me down
But it was just written in Time
Ya, ya, ya, you can't tell me nothing, nobody talked 'bout that shit as I ain't got a deal
And never took my songs seriously cuz I'm recording bedside my bed
And now they're all surprised to discover my name, fuck you, fuck the game
Fuck all your songs, fuck your fame, fuck, I'm wise enough to know the buzz will end
Thank you for the love but I've been used to pain, I cannot go out cuz I got songs to make
That shit is my life, for you it's just a phase, yes I got more hits, you're not ready for them
Yes I got more beats, than I got problems, when I'm done with it, get back to the paint
Thought I would end up like Gogh
, but God said : "Wait, nigga better stay, remember what I said"I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m not paying the hotel room
And I wanna see Sarah
Smoking blunts in the hotel room
Watching Rick and Morty high
I’m thinking
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out
Out of this world
But inside of my mind
I do everything I can to walk on the tightrope
Stuck in a paradox
One day I love you
The next day I’m chasing after them like Byron
I can’t fuck you cuz you’re way too beautiful
Beautiful
I don’t love you but I wish I could make love to you
All night long
I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m thinking[Intro:  Tommy Genesis &
Rilès
]
Oui c'est comme ça, haha
Comment tu dis "Let it go"
Laisse aller
Laisse aller, uh, c'est meilleur comme ça
Hahaha
Bitch I'm 'bout to let that bitch go
Let it go
Take some drugs
Let it fuck you up 
Real slow, slow 
Let it go 
Take some, drugs
Let it fuck you up
Real slow 
Man big, too tight, wow
Shook, I feel my bones
Looking inside, I know
Getting outside, I know
My bitch, lookin' like Kylie Jenner, uh
God, I never wanted better, uh
I'm tryna get sentimental
Tryna give it up, don't let 'em
I don't wanna break down
I've been in the booth, I think for too long, wow
Pitch, mix, combo
Wanna see outdoor
Middle-week, porno
Eee, ee, ee, ee
Pitch, mix, combo
Level thirty-one
Gotta get higher
Eee, ee, ee, ee
Rocketship, where the moon at?
Pink tongue on the drip of the peach fat
Losin' my mind, I'm too high for this
No oxygen when I'm comin' in
And I'm comin' in
And I'm smokin' it
Mouth workin' it
With no collagen
Just bones bitch
I'm skinny but the fat parts juicy
My brown skin with the blonde hair, cutie
Don't look back when the sky's fallin'
Heard it from him, I'm his favoriteOhmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Bitch, why you wanna love me?
10 months ago you were betting my defeat
Thinking I was too crazy for the shit that I'm in
Now you're sendin' me snaps of you and your tities
Talking to me like "Wassup, wassup, wassup Rilès!
I need an instrumental, can I record my text?"
They wanna be friends, personnal interest
But my hustle ain't free, and my talent is less
Wanna be me, they don't fuck with themselves
Wanna beat me , yeah I've tried but I failed
Trust me :
"Whaat? He French, he rappin' in English?
Who the fuck he is, what is this?" And I say:
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Haters, turning into friends
And friends turn into enemies
Problems come along with the fame
And It's just the beginning
If you see me less
It's 'cause that I'm doing more
I'm different I don't need your labels
Move on, I don't waste time anymore, no more..
Bitch niggas sayin' "it's luck"
I'm making it worth 'cause I'm putting in work
'Fore I be the best, I was probably the worst
Gotta thank all of your wack rappers raising my thrist
Saying shit like "Listen, listen, listen I know"
But you know the least, why you're talking the most?
Afraid of my dreams cuz you gave up on yours
So go talk to my advisor if it is for
pesos
,
hmar..
"Whaat? He rap, he produces and mix?
Who the fuck he is, what is this?" And I say:Help me Lord
I won’t do this all alone
I say welcome to the motherfuckin’
Jungle
, man
Where hopes and dreams feel bittersweet once you bath in it
Me? Let me swim in ignorance, you wanna win
How the fuck did I end up with scars all on my wrist?
Damn
I wanna be like the ones that I praise
What’s the price to pay?
Lil’ boy wanna play with the Timbs and the Ye’s
He’s so blind, he’s so passionate, he’s in his haste
Life is so beautiful when you fight for your dreams
Didn’t know me, begging for help
You can’t do shit so all on myself
You ain’t got time
You ain’t got skills
Or you don’t really want to cuz me no got no
bread
Damn
I wanna be blind again
Unfold my soul to the only thing I’m good at
And believe in utopias without crashing in pain
‘Cause I had no money in my pockets
But my head was full of them dreams
I thought I knew the story
Goddamn the real one’s far too mean
I had no money in my pockets
But my head was full of them dreams
So help me Lord
It’s time again
I run like I never did
Yema
say!
Oohh, oohh
Oohh, oohh
He just wanna be like nobody else
He just wanna be loved for what he is
Fuck up the game, ‘fore you fuck up like this
Better do what you said, if you say what you think
Pull up in the race
They don’t want to see you win
Depending on nobody but I’m enslaved to my sins
I’ll never be the same
Never really knew myself
It’s- It’s a marathon
Do I do know when it will end ?
Oh
Which one do you wish for me, bish
“Why do you preach for?”
“Please never switch, you a real one!”
Rich boy, will he rejoin what he reached for?
Still fresh out the Sheol, wasn’t shit tho
DamnIt's been a while, shit I missed the rehab,
psyche
was gone
Ain't no room for rest when demons whisper "We should've won
"
Ain't no room for miseria when you got all you want
You think I'm back at it, guess what ya
Hmar
, never been gone
Hey mama don't worry no more
Made 100k just from the store
Another million to record
The
bailiff
's daughters at my shows
I'm twice as blessed as I'm ignored
I need less but I want more
I still do my shit alone, 'cause alone is way too much
And they say
What the fuck is on? Who the fuck is in?
Where the hell you at? Where the hell you been?
Who the fuck is she? Who you dealing with?
Rilès back at it, Rilès never left
Do you want to leave 'em hating?
Or do you want to elevate 'em?
Do you want to keep the paving?
Boy you better not lose your patience
Dissed by nation, 'cause it's the fashion
But time's gon make all it's sense
I can do my shit alone, 'cause we're many in my head
September I finished it
November on the scene
Till December I built the entire store and made the prints
Enero
till April busy directing and cutting clips
GH5,
CS6
Lost some time but it's on fleek
Face to face you ain't gon' do shit
'Cause of course it's the internet
From all the letters I did receive
No one had the guts to come at my face
Niggas play roles
Niggas do flex
Niggas sell weed just to buy a street cred
So eat my balls
Suck another dick
And try to find yourselfOuh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Until we swoon
Don't look at me with them eyes
Feels like you're touching me
You play with my weaknesses
Let me play with your clit
I love your dress
I love that look
And I love your lips
Don't say too much
I'd rather hear you moan in my ear
Away from prying eyes
You put your hands on my dick
You pinch your lips
I touch your peach
You call me 'daddy'
Temptation at its highest
Feels like I'm giving in
Take off that dress
Get on me girl
You won't regret
Ouh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Until we swoon
Don't care where you from
What you did
Or what you study
But if it is the only way for me to get in
Don't care 'bout your diet
If you're vegan or glut-free
Mine's all about eating every inch of your pussy
Deep down
I know you're feeling it
Desire
Rising between your legs
Let me
Take a sip and drown
Ouh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Untill we swoonYou know darling
I think about you from time to time
And even though this is all over
I think there’s something to learn from that
As always; listen
When I knew, from the start
You’ve been playing, with men’s heart
I felt different from these losers, on the line 
But I see clear right now
I might be the next one
Let me tell you few things ‘fore
I find out
Don’t play my soul
Oh, don’t wake my woes
Oh, don’t bring my love
For no reason
But this song
When I stood
Right across the corner
You told me
You were with your mama
Didn’t really bought that shit
Yeah I crept and found that he was another one
Should I fuck him up?
Is it worth it?
Stay while you banging
Paying for a silent gunman, shit
Now my anger taking back my with, nah
Bitch you lost
Now I’m losing it
It ain’t my fault or is it
I mad at you eyes on me
Could’ve been the worst on this role
Why you belong to you flaws
Shame I thought you was no hoeI think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
Why you believe in something
If it brought skeletons
You was made to win
You was optimist
Now it feels like you're done
They envy where you sittin’
Seat ain't sweet
Seat is rough
Back to back it's the same old fight
They gon’ eat you live till' you front
I will fight the vision
But the vision is so clear
Feeding my soul with my sins
I'm choosing my life for the ending
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I wish sometimes I'd be dumb
I wish I walked more than run
And if I'm meant to be numb
At least I did what they can't
She feed me good, she my sun
She know I ain't a bad man
When everybody had a condescending picture of my psyche
It's all love and she knew it first
Bad man, bad man
Don’t forgive me when I’m-
Dead n gone
That's fine, that’s fine
It ain't your fault, nah
It's mine, it's mineSearching deep in my faults, pardon me 'fore I go
It’s cool to do shit alone, you make your mess on your own
I thought that cocky was cool, I think that trendy was fool
So badly wished I was you, I left myself with the truth
Now, changing locations, still a loner since then
Bosses told me: "You want to be featured? Gotta suck 'em"
Fuck you and your friends, all those industry plants
I teamed up with the Devil, and I think
I lost myself 
My soul 
My mind 
My goals 
My self 
My soul 
My mind 
I know
Why you keep wondering what you live for ?
Now your past is just regrets
Smoke, and let it in
Why you keep wandering, silently
Bro, you're still on a mission tell ’em
Even though
You lost your fuckin' self 
Your soul 
Your mind 
Your goals 
Your self 
Your soul 
Your mind 
You knowTell me what's your spell
I love the way you dance
Yes, I'm faded with my friends
We love the way you sing
Back the fuck up, slow the fuck down, I cannot be insane
She told me "Don't fall in the trap", it's too late, tie me to the pole, I won't ever do what I did
Right cannot feel my eyes, my ears, nor my self, swimming in a ocean full of blood and my tears
Tell me where the hell has gone my good sense, my feels, if I do it, I did it, Imma do it again 
Ya know, it's up to you, amaze me's what you do
Sex and singing in tune, sirens coming for you
I know, it's up to me, nervous, why am I watching?
Emotionless I be.. Wake me up 'fore I sin
Tell me what's your spell
I love the way you dance
Yes, I'm faded with my friends
We love the way you sing
Tell me what's your spell
I love the way you dance
Yes, I'm faded with my friends
We love the way you sing
Baby don't be scared
Adore me, praise me, beg
Stare at me before your friends
The pain will feel ok
Why you resist? You can feel free, finally taste what you seek
She told me to fall in her arms 'fore I knee, beggin' my niggas to let me run to her sheets
Right now cannot feel my eyes, my ears, but them lips, if I'm neither drunk or high, what the hell is this?
Splatting colors in a place that seemed dull & dim, then you forget that you're drowning deep and indeed Where should I start? Or where should I go?
To every motherfucker who only saw my past job
Was a monitor for less than a year, 4 days a month
My real job was selling paintings,
to build where I record
I ain’t a novice, you might see me as new in you lane
Just 'cuz I had no exposure don't mean I can’t son the game
Shoutout to SEB who started the fire cuz it’s really real
The papers gon’ ignore your existence, less you got a deal
Yeah, yeah I already said it, fuck they didn’t believe my vision
Let me tell you more ‘bout my trip,
tho you won’t get every pieces
So.. why you rapping in English? I started when I was 14
I had to hide from my parents that I sang and began writing
Cuz it is all about the studies, music is buffooneries
They did many sacrifices from Algeria to Paris
I did try to write in French, my BIC was freezing
Wanted to.. Rap out loud… But didn’t want to share it
So I wrote it in a language they didn’t know
My thoughts, my emotions, joys and troubles undercov’
My early bars were shit, but for my friends I was like Hov’
So I gradually took it seriously,
and had bigger goals yet..
..Needed to improve myself, my weakness had to be strength
Made a choice they didn’t fuck with,
went to college for my verses
Studied the English language and literature for 3 years
From Shakespeare to Hemingway
,
but it wasn’t for the B.A
Aside of that I had no dineros
Only my devotion and faith for what I had to show
I spent my whole scholarship on stuff for the studio
Always buying second-hand, the grid of my mic is still broke
But I learned to take the less and made better than the most
4 a.m. for a preamp, in his Saxo baba drove
Me To Paris, it was worth it, as I bought it for 4
Hundred dollars less than what the original really cost
Give me my money, money back I’m on a rush man
My bullets going straight they never swoosh man
I was in Paris for that money ‘bout a preamp
Also for a freestyle, but that’s behind me
Now that I had all in my hands
It was ‘bout engineering
Alone with the internet
Had no teacher for that shit
And then I schooled the game up, shut the fuck up
What’s a fancy studio, when you can’t rap
Had no song in advance, nothing was planned
I just spent this whole year double turned in my bedroom, shit
Now it’s ‘bout million dollar deals, still at Mama’s crib
In less than a year, learned the same as if it equaled 10
With knives under my throat, I discovered more than I wished for
You can’t match the grind but you can kiss my...
Ok, ok, it’s cool you spoke about your grind and your struggle
It’s crazy you made it that far, but you forgot ‘bout a puzzle
In every song you’re teasing, talking shit we couldn't understand
Was It really deeper than that or bullshit you told & pretend, huh?
You should've talked about it!I got woes on my telephone waiting for response
‘bout my store they tried to destroy, twice a month ago
Baba knows, Mama’s stealing 0’s
Taxes on my throat
And I’m sitting here, afraid not be afraid anymore
She a witch
She knows what I did with my favorite bitch
Try to switch, from singing to spit, from writing to beats
I do shows right after meetings
My head’s in a spin
And you’re talking to me like I should know who the fuck you is
Huh?
You remind me of something 
I don’t know but something 
Should I should know something?
Fuck up my brain, me don’t understand
You remind me of something 
I don’t know but something 
Should I should know something?
Mmh, fuck up my brain, me don’t understand
I do bizz,
Hamdoulah
the skills
Got a lawyer, she ain’t taking fees
'Cause she my friendn, tho she overseas
Sometimes I whish she could allege against my sins
I got fucked up on the plane 'fore I signed up
It’s the fourth flight in a week, fuck your timezone
It's a fist fight, gotta flip minds, keep the ring tight
It's a 'hmhmhm' if the bitch bad
Picked a B'n'B and I made all the hits 
Produced all my shit but notes I cannot read 
I still play the guitar to attract them bitches 
I think I lost my thoughts with all that THC that’s why 
You remind me of something 
I don’t know but something 
Should I should know something?
Fuck up my brain, me don’t understand
You remind me of something 
I don’t know but something 
Should I should know something?
Mmh, fuck up my brain, me don’t understandIn spite of all their warnings
I know what I have to do, and I know I have to do it
Because the universe is by my side, and I'm not afraid to get hurt
As I am a punching bag ready to embrace defeat and disappointment
The pain of regret is something I'll never know
Because while a lot of people are governed by their fears and habits
I, am governed by my heart, and my dreams..
BANG
How can he beat the game? How can he spit them flames?
How can he dare go solo? nah, man he's insane..
How can he make them beats? How can he do the mix?
How can he do shit on his own? man, tell me..
Listen, Imma prove they were all wrong
When they told me all these dreams won't last long
Time is running soon I'll be dead and gone
So fuck outta here I'd rather walk alone
Yeah, yeah, war ready, better watch your back
Right now, oh, many corny, fakes and wack
Rappers, I'm 'bout to fuck this game no hack
Watch out I'm back, watch out I'm back, back, back..
How can he never quit? How can he be the shit?
How can he do the trick with these weekly classics?
Yes, Imma fuck them all, yes, Imma give'em raw
No, I ain't got 30 dudes behind my songs
Because I learned everything from scratch
In my bedroom everyday, everynight
I was enclosed while you were having fun
Window shutters I must not see the sun
Until I finished mastering the song
Pro Tools is cracked so this shit takes too long
Ok, I'm done, let's get back to Reason
Five beats a day for the whole summer long, long, lonnngg
After the darkness will come the sun
Mama don't worry I got you now
Pendulum still running for my life
Imma prove them, then away I'll fly
I'll be the rising sun
I'll be the clouds and I'll be the dust
Pendulum finally took me down
But I proved them, now away I flyOh
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring chance
Stack bands 
Hard hand, understand 
Sick genes
All in the head 
Study the game
I get in the game 
With me love so
Now she want it groovy, like she Coco, ah-ha-ha
I keep it sexy
Now she want it wavy like she Brandy
If you know, I care 'bout you
If you go, I'll fall asleep
If you pave the way I do
Take my heart, don't fuck it in
Baby wanna slap it on the floor 
She got me dizzy, I'm like "Damn, she want some more" 
I'm like "Oh my God, she take it back and forth" 
This shit got me fellin' like I'm fallin' off 
Baby wanna slap it on the floor 
She got me dizzy, I'm like "Damn, she want some more" 
I'm like "Oh my God, she take it back and forth" 
This shit got me fellin' like I'm fallin' off 
Since I quit the 3ein away
I guess, the finesse was upon my faith
Ballin' on and on, is great, with my chicharita
New race to the bank 
Right post, got the pic 
Two phones, no friends, ayy
Flate, flate, flate, trips
Same stones to my wrist
Right bench, wrong liftWhy I cannot really sleep tonight?
You sit here by my side
And I’m talking to you like you’re mine
While you
Run away from me every time
I’m missing when you smile
It is cold but you're waiting outside
Feeling my soul, I see the void
Like how you fit it
Is it my fault? Was it my choice?
What is the reason?
I see the stars, but in a sense
I feel your presence
I know you hear my words
Pâle is your face
Hope what I’m saying is not traumatizing
I know you’re sad, but it’s what makes you shinning
At the end of the night, leaving me without an answer once more
Tell mе why
I cannot really sleep tonight
You’re sitting by my side
And I’m talking with you likе you’re mine
While you
Run away from me every time
I’m missing when you smile
It is cold but you waiting outside
Stay by my side, I’ll wait oh
You can’t seem to find a way no
Stay with me while I’m chasing the sun, for you my love
I know all the words you pray oh
I see you from outter space now
And I'll shine on you everytime you're hopeless my love
Tell me why
You cannot really sleep tonight
You’re sitting by my side
And you’re talking to me like we one
Why you?
Run away from fear every time
I’m missing when you smile
It is cold but you're waiting outsideBig bank, new steps, suspect, foreign’s, my name, tax inspection
Money, money, they want money
Big fish, swim in, fresh problems
I’m getting it, similar shit
Bailiffs back in the days I was at mom’s
I know the drill, ain’t new to it
'Cause at the end, livin' on a cycle
Pickin' up which phone, Universal fucked up, in a week I get my freedom back
I can do my shit ‘lone, God has kept my songs when the devil wrote the contract
Yet I listened to the crooked man
Paid the price, full gain
Day 'n Nite, soul pain
At least I know that he real
Pull up on him with thе gang
I got plans for my problems
I’ll work this shit out, yema
I've been so big thеy came back 
I got plans for my problems
Baby I got this, stay back
This jinx misses me, damn bad 
We ain’t got the same time
I ain’t the ‘bout same quality, mine is local
I ain’t got DZ genes for nothing, don’t tell me the rules, nothing to lose
Breaking ceilings, psyche healing, what more can I say?
Vibe been peaking, switching feelings, natty building
Easy, djudju, waguan, sheitan
Missing different, thinking forward
Walking alone, don’t need no style
Don’t need new bitch on me tonight
Believe in it, I know you bluffin'
You in too deep to figure out
I generate, I’m in a Reiki
It’s way too deep fit her ass
Ouhh, I keep on looking away from inside like it wasn’t my fault
Baby you walked in life and it wasn’t the plan
I know the vibe is a match, but it wasn’t a choice
You were the one I missed nowOk, let’s go, I'ma do it like this
No sleep, ‘less I got all of my rings back
I stay strong, barely speak
Life’s a light 6, all about the struggle in the limelight
Cheers, martini with tears
No turning back since I told you the secret
Bad man mixed, with a little bit of freak
Hope you don’t feel what's inside my cabeza, yessa
Es la mania
I swear it drives me really crazy, ‘till manana
Don’t need to sleep, I gotta dance
La mania
I swear it drives me fucking crazy, ‘till manana
Don’t need to sleep, I’m on a race
Even when I’m sick and fed up better than y’all motherfuckers
Watch out when the pace slows down
Doing me, I likе it better
Wasn’t made for trophiеs, obviously, wonder whats my style
One day you dance and the other you mad
The fuck you rappin', when you sing so sad?
Easy mind schism, I like it both side
Cannot box me, I’m a big boy now
I’m a big boy, I’m a really big boy
I don’t say shit, nah, I act it, on my life
I’m a big boy, really, really big boy
With a kind of trippy trouble on my mind
Es la mania
I swear it drives me really crazy, ‘till manana
Don’t need to sleep, I gotta dance
La mania
I swear it drives me fucking crazy, ‘till manana
Don’t need to sleep, I’m on a race
Man on race from France
I'ma go around the globe, it might take a little while
I need to curve my demons, pay for my taxes and raise my pride
You can’t steal my mania, I got it from my mama but I won’t breakdown
Only trust myself, now cut them producers, I'm on my styleI wish I had the time to spend with you my love
I wish I had the time to travel out my  thoughts
I wish I had the time to focus on my soul
I wish I had the time to live a little more
I wish I had the power to let go when its done
I wish I had the flowers, and smell em ‘fore I'm gone
I wish I had the money, and the fame without being lost
I wish I had the time to forget and move on
Watchout, stand up, do it, get up
Want it, proove em, cannot, forget
I wish I had the time to spend with you my love
I wish I had the time to travel out my  thoughts
I wish I had the time to focus on my soul
I wish I had the time to live a little moreBang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, listen babe
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, let me say
Hey
What you've done?
Look at me
Look at me now
I guess I shouldn't make a song for you
Why the fuck I felt like at home with you?
But sometimes home ain't 'bout 4 walls
It's just two eyes and a heartbeat
And you fucked it up on your own, don't ya?
I guess I should've shed a tear for you
But I ain't really had the time for it
I used to have a good heart
Now tell me where the fuck he at
I might have lost it in your bed
Babe I know I was young
And maybe I was stupid
Is it 'cuz I hate love that I'd rather fuck them groupies?
I came off as strong but the inner me was dying
A
cting like nothing's wrong
Maybe I'm good at lying
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, let me say
Hey
What you've done?
Look at me
Look at me nowWhen you shake that ass for me, it’s about the waveforms
You relieve the pain with it, you know what I like
Oh, I keep slapping it, 'cause I like your waveforms
Cannot help starring at it, love is your design
Out of my head or out of my mind
Need the kind of distraction that puts the focus on sight
Making beats up in morning, mixing 'em before the evening, mastering on every night
I need to bounce but not the session, hun
Out of my self or out of my life
Going back to earth when it’s your waves inside of my palms
Mega pressure evеry morning, feeling like I start to lose it hopefully I got thе best view and with you I live my best life
I don’t want to chase to nothing chase nothing else, but the way you moving that body
Oh, right I’m tired of my sins but with you it’s better than heaven
I don’t need to know how you love me, when I see you move that body
Oh, right now I’m tired of my life but with you it feels like there’s more
When you shake that ass for me, it’s about the waveforms
You relieve the pain with it, you know what I like
Oh, I keep slapping it, 'cause I like your waveforms
Cannot help starring at it, love is your design
Shake it baby mama, you’re a star
Keeping the BPM toute la nuit
I like when you come on me with your own style
I know it’s not fake when it moves like agua 
Baby gently like it like that
What's the frequency inside your body
I don’t need more bass you sounding like my type
Teach how to mix with your vibe, 'cause
I don’t want to chase to nothing chase nothing else, but the way you moving that body
Oh, right I’m tired of my sins but with you it’s better than heaven
I don’t need to know how you love me, when I see you move that body
Oh, right now I’m tired of my life but with you it feels like there’s moreHey, hey, hey, hey
You better wake the fuck up, man
Kick it, fucked up
Break in, walk up
She like how I beat box
When I’m in it
I came in fuck a dance floor
I don’t play goofy shit, no time
I’m on my worst behavior
Two henny, fuck a 3ein all night
Baby girl, is you thirsty?
Fifteen month, I forgot how to chase right
I like to get in straight
Taking shortcuts, no control in my life
I know you like staring at me girl
Everyone in my circle told me
You’re the meanest and you’re a freak girl
Now you all in my mind, I’m diving
All in, all night
Alone, inside
I can’t think about shit but
Slide in left and right
Boots and cats in your punani like I
Kick it, fucked up
Brеak in, walk up
She like how I beat box
Whеn I’m in it
I came in fuck a dance floor
I don’t play goofy shit, no time
I’m on my worst behavior
Two henny, fuck a 3ein all nightYo, Joshy
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Two brains, tight grips, nights to plan
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Take a risk, is a brick, or the streets
Ain't like everybody, knows somebody
Learned to shake ´em hands before the gang signs
We been through stresses, troublings, curse, strugglings
If we’re getting checks, it's a good time
Started like, ouhh
Two best friends on a penny roll
Now we like, ouhh, aah
Get it right
Money beneficial but an option
I just rather flexing with the patience
Never out of facts or out of line
Beg it want it bad, chase it on the run
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Two brains, tight grips, nights to plan
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Take a risk, is a brick, or the streets
Ain't like everybody, knows somebody
Learned to play ´em chess before I get signed
We been through stresses, troublings, curse, strugglings
If we’re getting checks, it's a good time
If we're getting checks it's a good time
And if we're getting paid, it's another day
I'm getting more cousins since I got signed
But I'm only here for patience on the long way
Fuck you mean “a wrong way” ?
I cannot stand half of what you saying 
So I signed up for half of the checks
I don’t want a blueprint with reference 
I’ma get the quote from my self 
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, ouhh x2
Oh I swear on that day
Mama I felt your pain
Oh I swear, since that day
Imma fight until this bitch will finally get away
I know you got
Problems with liquor
Plus you're all alone, no money, with my sister
You were far from being a perfect mother
This hysteria didn't really help ya
You often offended me when I was a young boy
One day you even said you wished I was not born
I can't blame you, 'cause I love ya
Imma do my best not to see you suffer..
Again cuz this shit is stuck in my head
First time I ever saw Mama at work
I understood why she said "damn it's hell"
She's been cleaning shit for more than 10 years
I wouldn't even stand one fucking day
No she had no friends, no one to talk to
Yes a lotta racists look what she's been through
Being the only terrorist of the whole crew
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"
Something she never said
She shut her mouth for the mumu
Went back home, tired as fuck
Problems never left her shoes
Debts and bills, drugs & pills
Imma fuck this game for you
 x2
Oh I swear on that day
Mama I felt your pain
Oh I swear, since that day
Imma fight untill this bitch will finally get away
Away, away, away..
Away, away, away..
I don't want to see you working anymore
Once I'm blowing up, you will go fuck'em all
Holidays for life, let them sweep the floor
You deserve the best, but right now we stilll poor
One day Imma be able to pay your debts
From them raps & beats I'm making by myself
All these labels trynna be my friend
You told me to be boss and not to be a slave
So Imma raise the check
Raise the check
Up to the milli yeah
So Imma raise the check
Raise the check
Up to the milli yeah"I told you
I told you the struggle is only starting
Believe me"
Weed in my lungs
Weed on my mind
Why the fuck am I smoking like a Rastafarian ?
Buddin' the beat
Like weed in my brain
That why the tempo slowed down
But got my mind overspeeding
And you're deflecting
You got a thousand shit to do
But you're in her sheets
Your priorities fucked up
And lust is rising
You're waking up every morning
Bemoaning what you did
You reminisce the time you wasted
But cannot undo
You've been screaming "don't"
Little Devil whispered "I do"
Push me and my trust
Need to drink a tea with Badu
'Front of your body
Mine is struggling to handle
Way too much food for thoughts
And new philos
For things that fool on you and your focus
It is all around
Yet makes no noise
And got no shape
Goddamn
I can feel it
And I still bounce between feelings baby
Troublesome times
Not safe for work
Got me going crazy
All night long
And I still bounce between feelings baby
Troublesome times
Not safe for work
Got me going crazy
All night long
It has the finest ass
I won't talk about the face
If you look into its eyes
Lust will put you to your knees
It's starting with a sight
Then it's all over your psyche
Don't try to shout it out
Or you will turn into D.O.C
Noxious
Hades wants to bathe me in his fire
But Rilès got it all over his arms
So ladies don't tear my clock all appart
When this chronic got me wildin' on your body
Ouh
Well, I'm dancing with the Devil
In the stud
It's 'bout bad consequencesChorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and round
Verse 1:
Got a bitch ringing on my phone
I don't want to answer
Messin' with the evils of my nature was a flex, nah
Man, I think I love her
Made it till
nirvana
Can't fall back on earth I'm way too way too good in heaven
Easy to  selfdestruct when i feel far from you
I try to work on me, but there's too much to do hmmmm
Chorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and round
Verse 2:
SMS, relieving the stress
She my bitch
Oh no she my hess
Latina juice
Drippin down your legs
Boy i'm starting to pity my old self
Making love with no love
Sex with no scrapes
I'd never go brutal
If she wants sweet
And If you trust me
I trust you
We'll keep it true
Chorus:
I got you under my skin
Oh, Sugarbabe hold me down
Oh you, ward off my sins
When they go round and roundDon't be afraid of how your life will be ending
And maybe wonder if it has really started
I'm getting sick in my psyche and I know it
If I don't make it tomorrow
I'm proud to say "Got no regret"
Oh no no
You got nothing to lose
Not even yourself
Give'em truth, it's all that you got
I say "Nothing's too much"
I know one day I'll pass out
I don't know how to stop 
Enjoy the ride
It won't be long
Enjoy the ride
I know tomorrow I'll be gone
Enjoy the ride
It won't be long
Enjoy the ride
Jump in that car and play my song
I work on every song as if it is the last one
Never slow down cuz every day feels like my last run
If you're wondering where's my boundaries I got none
You're wondering if I got Prozac? Yes I got some
But never used it
Nor abused it
I refused it
When my yema didn't
You won't use me with your bullshit
I told him
I'm getting aggressive when they do not deserve it
But oh
You got a place to cure the pain
You got your hands, you got your head
You got your heart, your brain
Your pen, your beats, your paint
Now use that shit
Amen!121135, for as long as you got legs, you gon' walk the shit up
As long as you got hands, you gon' work this shit out
No cap, no shortcuts, no cheat codes
You gotta learn the hard way, the only way
Oh la la, Shaz
Since young I’ve seen ups and down
I cannot quit now, while my mind be tricking
Voices silent, mad for the sound
I cannot fail in this bitch
I cannot forget, on my mama
So I'ma keep on walking for the show
Inside I'm feeling all the pain
I'ma hustle till I can’t no more
I'ma do it till it changes
Since young I’ve been on my shit
I cannot get weak, on my spirit
As I drove through the valley of my shadows
And I was riding alone, at night, thinking
Bitch don’t give in
So I'ma keep on walking never
Laidback, I don’t chase that
Coming back, feeling like it’s on my first time
Don’t cap, understand that
Well, I'ma keep on spending money and time
Stresses and pain
All for thе ride, ain’t like I’m used to it
So I'ma keep on walking for thе show
Inside I'm feeling all the pain
I'ma hustle till I can’t no more
I'ma do it till it changesThis is just a cellphone
That's alright
Real love's from the real ones
That's alright
Why'm I looking down tho
Am I right?
Didn't want no war no
That's alright
You want me dead or me down
Don't like the way I'm expressing myself
I just want love for my craft
Me sacrificing everything for it
I don't know love, don't know life
Don't know vacations, don't know nothin' else
When you shit on my work
Maybe that hits me in a different way
Could you believe all they say?
Nah it's alright
Country's hating, all that hate
Nah it's alright
Medias still cut me off, still by myself? right
Imma promote the project, the only way, I-

Beeping soundC'est carré quand c'est Bloody
Looking back, erasing
I don’t want no paperback
Mistakes or understatements
Hopping through relationships
And maybe it’s the new
Maybe it’s the nonsense of it all
But there was truth
And baby you
Kept me safe on instinct
Why you wanted me for?
Wanted me
Oh, baby you
Gave me a chance for real
I’m never falling for love
Falling for, love
And I swear I'ma try to find my best
Not to fall in darkness where you found myself
Who’re these bitches now?
Looking back, erasing
I don’t want no paperback
Mistakes or understatements
Hopping through relationships
And maybe it’s the new
Maybe it’s the nonsense of it all
But there was truth
Now I can assume, I’m getting through
Ready to choose, and I want you
'Cause you’ll be my lady
Since sometimes can be forever
I swear my lady
No, I don’t ever wanna change
Baby you, kept me safe on instinct
Why you wanted me for? 
Wanted me
Oh, baby you
Gave me chance for real
I’ve never fallen for love
Fallen for, love1, 2, 1, 2 ,3 4
I wish it could be just like the old days
The ones I used to love, I mean, the old days
When I was not the same back in the old days
When I thought I was sane, but it’s the old days
Lately I been thinking ‘bout them old days
When I didn’t lose myself but neither found it
The balance of ignorance for my young age
Yes I will do my best to feel these old days
Back before the racks
Before the swag
I wish I could feel like I’m fading the black
Wish I could feel like I’m still on the track
‘The fuck every morning just feels like a trap?
Back
Before the threats and the tats
Before the fame and the platinum plaques
Back
When hate was not in the ride
‘Fore they fantasized ‘bout me ending my life
I wish it could be just like the old days
The ones I used to love, I mean, the old days
When I was not the same back in the old days
When I thought I was sane, but it’s the old days
Why this, on my way no
Darkness, everywhere oh
Why me? Why myself? No
I won’t, fall in hell oh
It’s gon be ok, just like the old days
I will face my fears, just like the old days
I’ll take care of myself, just like the old days
I’ll thank God every day, just like the old days
I wish it could be just like the old days
The ones I used to love, I mean, the old days
When I was not the same back in the old days
When I thought I was sane but it’s the old daysBitches blacking out at my shows

And it's, and it's just the beginning
Gon' tell my boss I quit that job
Beautiful women in my phone
Overseas fucking with my songs
And it's, and it's just the beginning"The unfortunate person who gets started in that , finds himself getting into an ever increasing posess ,where he starts out with the idea of how to get to her mind,You know, it's something far"
My darling i want some bitches,fame and fortune
Went too far with all the bills, candles, oceans
I wish my parents were pillards and not jobless
I wish I would've been warned when I made mistakes
I wish I could really handle all the hate
All the lies, the plans ,the tricks, planned against my will
I say "ça a passé"
You threw your demon's at me
Why? Man brought me there
I'm alone in my bedroom finding myself screaming
Eeeeeeeyyyyyooooooooaaaaaaaaaeeeeooooooo
Eeeeeeeyyyyyooooooooaaaaaa..a..a..a
It's my style of tribulation
I used to run out of patience then diving in real depressions, planning a runaway
It's my style of tribulation
I used to run out of patience then she came in my direction blessings still follow me
My darling, I spent my savings making them clips
Spending days behind the screen but, shit it ain't tits
I'ma soon go back to broke broke, slide my richness
Aggravating mental health since I can't pay rents
Oooo
Sa7bi Look at you
Sa7bi Look at them
You got love tho you got pain
You got brothers tho you got hate
Sa7bi look at you
Sa7bi look at them

M3a dikrayatI wanna be the best for that I’m dying
I’m checking on my wrist before my time is gone
My body is a rock and I am stoned in
It’s something that I’m trynna solve when on my own
I’m feeling bitter sweet in, like I love it
Somedays I feel like I wanna be someone else
With all the shit I got, you’d think I’m playin’
But fuck you know ‘bout me?
It ain’t my fault 
Was born like this 
That feeling’s strange 
But I’m used to it 
It ain’t my fault 
Was born like this 
Can’t feel the pain 
But in my skin
I try to be my best instead, I’m all for it
I didn’t walk away, that means I’m here for some'
They didn’t undеrstand when I was struggling
They cannot understand unlеss I get it solved
I’m still unbreakable and that I know it
Why you don’t you stop reminiscing the shit I done
'Cause I’m done taking steps before the run
I’m ready for the war with a uzi on my mind
Didn’t go with the plan, every since I was starting
Talking with the angels, made me want to quit living
Crazy how the fame tricks your mind ‘till its dangerous
Crazy how the game wasn’t what you thought of it
I, I, I get it
Alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you can leave or live with it
Don’t try to explain, if you get it you relate
Now I take off all the chains, can’t forget that
It ain’t my fault 
Was born like this 
That feeling’s strange 
But I’m used to it 
It ain’t my fault 
Was born like this 
Can’t feel the pain 
But in my skinStitches all on my mind
I got a lot of stitches all on my mind, oh-oh, oh
Stitches all on my mind
I got a lot of stitches all on my mind, ouh-ouh
Stitches all on my mind
I got a lot of, stitches all on my mind
They won’t go unless I pick the gun
Oh, please baby
I'ma feel confident
Follow me, comprehend
Daffodil for the strength
I’m a sinner and a saint
Darkness, stopin’ it
Governance, I’m on it
Dopeness, just a bit
I’m a fighter and a freak show
‘Cause every good kick ends up in the full throat
I'ma keep the same face when I picture your corpse
Never tired of this, boy, you don’t know what time it is
In case, boy, watch your mouth ‘fore you’re replying shit
Stitches all on my mind
I got a lot of stitches all on my mind, oh-oh, oh
Stitches all on my mind
I got a lot of stitches all on my mind, ouh-ouh
Stitches all on my mind
I got a lot of, stitches all on my mind
They won’t go unless I pick the gun
Oh, please baby
Sorry, babe if I end up in the news
I want it all I know they want it too
'Fore I get in I gotta break the rules
Never forget no one’s forever new
I’m only mastering my patience
Right after compressing my edges
Alright, please, keep on stopping me
Without competition I wouldn’t know the hell I’d be
Would testify my felonies
Tighten up with a wife and kids
Waiting Death on a registry
Pick, and choose but never did
Nothing for living, enough for just chilling
Nodding but never getting it
Pouring amphetamines, happy until I
to-to-to-toI am not a hero
I am not a good guy
I know I will deceive ya'
But my vision ain't yours
Unless proven otherwise
It's me holdin' the reins
Hun?
I am not a hero
I am not a good guy
Fuck your reckoning
Yeah bruh
You're watching when I speak
Listenin' when I paint
If you're cripped, don't swim
Bruh
Be the best, be the best..
Be that motherfucka
Be like this, more like him
Mislead me you sucka
Me the chief, you the creep
Shape me I destroy ya'
Me real Indi, well indeed
I can't really trust ya'
Out of sight niggas
Corazon que no siente
Say my shit was better before
But y'all were not there
Literally sold 5 copies of my mixtape
Back in the days I believed in Chano's independence
Huh
Livin' in the stud
Pass the bull
Morning afternoon
Enclosed in the cube
Work that groove
Always got the woo
Ideas step, I stew
All my beats
Got that genius brew
You better listen fool
I'm the one
Ain't no room for two
Oh lord
On my K-Dot shit
Shoutout for the flow
Bruh
Gotta kill my beat
Say, Oh lord
I'm mooving so quick
You got 1 song
You're on radio
You might have ate a dick
Yea my bad if my songs get a lil darker
Me don't go outside anymore
Days be shaping like a looper
I don't wake up, I can't sleep
Cook a meal and make a beat
Two more, then finally got ten
Cuz never satisfied with me
But i see myself improving
I learned some shit I couldn't see
Getting bette than EI-P
An closer to the D-R-E
Ricky Rubin, Timbo, 40
I'm coming for your asses quick
I can and I'll still be waiting
I ain't got time but I got will
Twenty One years old
I work like five men
Never ever losing my momentum
Don't speak english, yet they sing my anthems
Beats too good they don't believe I made them
Rappper, Producer, Engineer, Video Director, Painter
I don't give two fuck
If you think I say it too much
Oh lately they've been too many
To are about them toony niggas
Yeah too bad
Take a toothbrush

Now listen
He stated "sing for the hoes and rap for these niggas"
I'm Russ on steroids and Gogh on SSRIs
King Kunta with his feet
Swing, never switch my style
Life is short
Art is not
If i die my music won't
HeyBaby girl, a sensation, on the low
Would you fill me up, would you fill me up?
Baby girl, I see you alone and slaying on your way
I been watching you not far from myself
Wishing I could’ve call you on my own
You gonna know 
Cocaina
Cannot solve 
Your dilemma, your dilemma
Touch me softly, kiss me harder
Take my body, put me higher
Put me higher
Hey, babe
Touch me softly, kiss me harder
Squeeze me all the way, you can use me, oh
I want you, oh, oh

I know she comе from Beriz
Sex and tension shе cherish

You running on my soul, soul, soul 
I want you bad, too bad you bad too
You miss a man he bad you mad fool
Don’t run away, all for the sins
Them nights ain’t looking the same
I want you bad, too bad you bad too
I miss a girl she mad I want you
I ran away, 'lone with my sins
Don’t turn them night to regretsCosmo, envoie, des, track, track, tracks !
Pick it up, new G-wagon
Hop it in give me brains
How can I get more patience
Speed it up bish my kishta drains
I get up with my dragon
How could I miss my chance ?
How could I get more vacant
Beefing my flows or switch my range of sauces
My bitches love it, I toss it
You wish, I shop it
I mix, I own it, we tie splits
Advance, exclusive
A lot, but losing
Refuse it, shit is a ‘soucis’
Rapping for Suzy’s, you soothing 
Pick it up, fool distractions
How can I get more gems
How can I get more patience
Run it up bish my kishta spreads
Everyone taste my spices
Nobody match my taste
How can I get more decent
Double the stoves and serve em what they
Starving undertake it, as a matter of fact don’t fake it
Put a VV on my estate, dodging mediation these days
I like stressing, I like tensions
I like wearing off frustration
Made a milli on depression, then a city off relations
Bamboula, j’suis léwé
Enveloppe
La bana', c’est rodave
J’fais le show, tu fais du merch
Chat potté, bas côté
Un 2 temps
Au voleur, pas d’issues
L’avocat me dit quoi faire
Check my luck
Write my checks, wear my tusk
Where’s my jinx?
Shut my 3ein, wash my junk
Shit sustain
First you plan, then you play
Easy man
Schemes shift, seasons change
Once I thought It was about the mula
Then I learn to make ‘em small steps
How’d I forget time is all that we got
Out of love I wasn’t counting
Counting…
Count bro, man, the fuck you mean?
You better count your time
Your money…Rilès why you keep changing it?
Where’s your mind at?
Don’t you wanna get
Famous, rich
Better streams
Pop and die
Don’t you wanna sing less and shit
Or exchange your style?
Ain’t you afraid of numbers dropping?
Of falling off, watch it out
Can’t deny
But no longer give a shit, mamacita
Watch me do my self, on my own
I’m still the same, mamacita
Always do whatever I want
Watch me do my thing
Me finessing my faults
My timing under pressure
Been  like this from the start
I can’t give a shit about the bizz
See this gap is not a bridge
You and I it’s not the same zone
We don’t do that shit to please
I ain’t sour, I ain’t sweet
I don’t believe in y’all bozos
Run around in circle ‘side my head
Keep control on my sauce
I’m getting used to getting lost
But no longer give a shit, mamacita
Watch me do my self, on my own
I’m still the same, mamacita
Always do whatever I wantSometimes I feel like shit
But part of a rotation
It’s like an invasion of an old demon
A universal burden
That I hope will never take over my soul
Now get the fuck up, and run
My heart is frozen
My back is cold
I try to give me a reason
To keep on fighting for
My knees ain’t too weak
But my mind is broken
Still by myself, another season
I wasn’t ready for
And I been runnin', runnin', runnin' like forever my babe
Thought about stoppin it all, on the low
Yet I keep runnin', runnin', runnin' like forever my babe
So let me die on the stage for the show
I keep on going and mistaking my freedom for something granted
And I’m still fighting for my self when nobody around
I know the limelight is a fraud
Fame is not a goal, nah, nah, nah, nah
Fuck a danse, fuck a jewelry
Focus less on buffonery
Pick a side, cannot lose it when
Living life on a uzi
I don’t mind ‘bout your insight
Enough of mine, understand that
I’m a man, avec le Z
Got a plan, it’s all in my head
You sick of them, then get a gem
HODL it, get rich when I die
My luck is missing
Yet I got my stones
All by myself, I need the peace in 
Is this what I’m here for?Wassup, what's good?
What’s poppin', what’s new?
Is you trippin'?
I’m just feeling myself, stop buggin'
Check my flavors, I don’t scrap my flex
Basic hoes, don’t feel it, I don’t mind flat taste
Oh la la, Shaz
I don’t smash flat, fuck it
I don’t really wanna fuck up
Shaz, he blessing with the bass
On the weekend, I be late
Need a bounce, I make this shit work
Gotta keep it with the pace
And I’m stressin' everyday
So I’m switching my style like Changela
Picking my flows too easily
Mixing my shit with a little bit of a sauce
And a bitter slice of a pressure, nice taste in it
So wassup, what's good?
What’s poppin', what’s new?
Who trippin', is that you?
I’m just feeling myself, stop buggin'
Wassup, what's good?
What’s poppin', what’s new?
Who trippin', is that you?
I’m just making my way, stop buggin'
Bitch, listen when I speak
Off of the stress when I follow the vision
Mad man tweaks, mininum flaws
I know my lifespan is close to a stallion
I know my name means I’m built like a lion
Inside never drying, I make it arousing
You faking inspiring, I keep with the cadence
You’re lagging behind it, I don’t feel distracted
Don’t overthink, it's just a race man
This is your ass versus your dumbass versus the whole ass world
And if you moving step by step without looking at mountains ahead you
You might get there faster than you thinkBijan 4 The 1 Time
I saw you ain’t around town
Would you like a one dance ?
I don’t wanna make shit up
My Messina put a spell on my nights
I didn’t feel a first time in forever
Wasn’t just a hope, just a hope
Follow me, I feel like on our way together, don’t you?
Follow me, we gotta see what else we haven’t done for now, done for now
Stay with me, I need a friend to talk on deeper issues
Stay with me, I wanna reassure you from this life with love
Ya habibi ya
, ya habibi ya
Ya noori ya
, I ain’t losing ya
Ya habibi ya, ya habibi ya
Ya noori ya, I ain’t losing ya
My flaws, my jinx, my hoes, my lust, my greed
All of this gone no time
My love, my sense, my lead, my mind, my wings
All of this back with you baby
I swear I’m too sah baby
You and I both likе childs in it
Again I will stand
For you I can do what I can’t
Follow me, I feel like on our way togethеr, don’t you?
Follow me, we gotta see what else we haven’t done for now, done for now
Stay with me, I need a friend to talk on deeper issues
Stay with me, I wanna reassure you from this life with loveHere goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make it run onto your shirt
Here goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make me do what I don't want
Damn, I see you're tryna fool me son
Is you niggas deaf or blind? I told you once
Making me repeat myself, so you waste my songs
Could've talked about my babe or about that cunt
Niggas be all afraid to talk to me dace to face
Fake your trace, pace me for weeks then fade
Your fable's fake and speech is vain
3andek, we know where's your basement bitch
Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
Youngsters be listening my shit, fuck if I shook them
You made me quit the stud, so better run then
Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
I was in Paris for my money and a freestyle
But I knew I was too high to be a Frenchman, hmhmm..
Here goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make it run onto your shirt
Here goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make me do what I don't want
Many men, wish death upon myself
Acting like they're not looking, but follow my steps
All you want is revenga since I left your business
It was the greatest decision I could've ever made
I'm hearing from others you do like to mention my name
Shit I've been wasting all this time cuz you stood in my way
Next time it's coming out your mouth my dick gon fill your chin
Don't make me pull the trigger on you, I know you got kids
Others be spitting their venim on some industry shit
"don't sign him", "don't talk about this kid"
"too optimistic", "dangerous for what we're in"
I'm crazy? Nahh.. just a little bitHey, it's Rilès
I'm not available at the moment
But please give a message and I'll try to call you back
I got way too many hoes on my phone, on my phone
Don’t waste my time I’m trying to be alone, be alone
And if I say I got to save my soul, save my soul
It means I try not to pick up my phone, on my phone
I swear I got these bitches loving, which is lovely
I don’t want to be too selfish, let me dive in
I don’t wanna tease what you expect 
Don’t try 
I won’t  fall back into the trap
 I have , bеfore
I got way too many hoes on my phone, on my phonе
Don’t waste my time I’m trying to be alone, be alone
And if I say I got to save my soul, save my soul
It means I try not to pick up my phone, on my phone
Run around, jinx
Been around freaks
It ain’t my choice
It's just my D
Blame it on the others, but myself
If it’s a hoe it ain’t my fault
You a whole clown
But let me tell you some'
You blocked me and stopped shit
But If I wanted to come
And fuck up your house
And fuck up your car
And fuck up your girl, I can
You could’ve fucked anybody but you chose meI can go in
The jungle is a threat, you might lose yourself
Oh lemme go in
Was made for this tho sometimes i doubt it well
Business, feelings
Scratch n writings
Numbers, streaming
Buzz n fading
Cash is laking
Yet i can't quit
Demons yelling
Kush ain't healing
All this hate not really helping
I thought i was down but i'm deeper
Ah yema..
Watch out for the goons
Bro the fame is a bad man
If you quit they gon feast right
Everybody knew
But they shh
If you're too strong
Jealousy when the man climbs
And the girls turn into snake now hmm
ATM be my name now hm?
I swear I got the feeling that my feelings dead
Oh baba, yema
Everyone changed
Is you still the same with me  ?
Not feeling sane
Oh baba yema
Everyone changed
Or am i just breaking down down down
I might not make it, lord lost me there
Angels 'bove my head already gone
Pray for me as i am just a man
Terrified by demons chasing himI think I need a girl who does meditation
'fore I go numb and fall apart
I need to go for resolutions
If I want to make it till tomorrow
Them drugs inefficient
I feel insignificant like juju and curses
Took the time to make a remake of my sins, choices, mistakes
Eyy
I know I'm gonna do it
Do it again
And even more
Chik chak
I face myself
Troubling both my wit, my sense
Buckle up
My 3ein, my din
Hopefully get down with finesse
Business
Distress
Rilès you forget yo self
I still didn't switch
Witness
My fall and then me ascent
And if you're there
Hesitation
Would it be just an illusion
Well if I sense
Your vibration
I won't ever be on my own
I think I need a girl who does meditation
'fore I go numb n fall apart
I need to go for resolutions
If I want to make it till tomorrowIXI
Everybody on my side
I keep it slow, I try to focus on the run
Everybody by my side and pushing shit until we get it done
Everybody by my side I wouldn’t sleep for shit, marissa
Everybody knows
So I keep on feeding my steps for better
I don’t plan stand-bys, man
Always on pivot, don’t rush true patterns, still
Running down the streets
Even on my knees
I just keep on filling days on the wall
Always stuck on the go
Too slow, but steady
From the very start, been ready 
Dark ass glance got 'em running straight to their daddies
I gotta keep my pace in control
Like honestly, my faith is in growth
 used to being called an alien
No offense taken, I know many here
In the meantime, still
[Chorus : Rilès,
Gracy Hopkins
]
Running down the streets
Even on my knees
I just keep on filling days on the wall
Always stuck on the go
[Verse 3: Rilès,
Gracy Hopkins
]
Peak down, slip slight
I feel my jinx, my woes
I don’t talk cheap back, fix that
She want me, I won’t lose
You can’t stand when I talk about truth
No Shakespeare and I know
I know, I know, I know
You hate it when I’m on the road
Got too much to lose, we don't waste time
Highs to the lows, survive, convert it, make it fit on a bassline
The energy a currency
I'm meant for way higher, I ain't happy with the current seat
Pops getting old, got me working in emergency
Clock's ticking, gotta use what God's giving
Rushing, yeahTwenty9
I know your my bae don’t get me wrong
But you caught me in your bed when I was on
What you wanna know, you’re waiting for
I know who you is not what you want
I got just a lil- just a doubt
Tell me if you want me all alone
I got wishes for us but you don’t
When I’m on knees
Why you thinking I’m too dangerous?
When you hold my tears
Is you feeling what this means for us
Baby
pourquoi tu prends peur?
J’ai pas voulu faire de mal

Carevd in minds of who you really praise
Everybody wants to take your seat, forsake
You shall not go after you made it, man
Not enough to get the man a name
From the bottom of the jungle
To the perfume of a blunt
Gotta quit the Remington
Frome the beauty of the sun
To the booty of my girl
I won't leave you 'till I'm done
I know I gave it lot of praises
But damnation feels like it's fading away
I know I gave y'all lotta hard times
Though t my mission would end after 52 songs
Shut down the suicide doors
This is my life, homie
You decide yours
Y'all know that Ye was my force
This ain't my time
I still gotta eat more
Y'all know that he talked to me
"Find a way to tell 'em
Then you'ill go back to me"
Wut ?
This is how it was supposed to be
I don't want that shit anymore
Sorry Lord I'm more than just a puzzle
I know I'm running the risk
Won't ever know what's rest
Oh no no
I know I'm running the risk
Don't you want me to dare ?
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet

What if I was the trap I didn't know

But the jungle's in my way

Dja-dja, dja-dja
Dja-dja, dja-dja 
Dja-dja, dja-dja 
I got up, I got up, I got up 
Then I felt as if I, never would 
I got up, once again I got up
I got up, I got weak, then I walked
Aye, penetenciary flow like Abdul
If you wanna be damned, fuck it, that's on you
What you really mean? Darkness, was awful then
But shit got an end
Look how son, this shit did become 
Please don't  'til we're done 
Truth be told, it's real dumb 
If you don't like it don't listen 
I got up, I got up, I got up
I got up, 'cause I got them
I got feelings, I got needs
But the jungle's in my way 
I'm still healing, but not weak
If I'm in, I gotta stay 
Should I care?

I pulled up in it like a rookie with plans
I’m leaving it with half of all my fan base
They sipping in your blood, until the shit dies
And see you as a trophy for their conference
Type of deal you putting in a movie 
Kind of people talking like a Lucy 
Easy praising on a bidding war ‘fore you entering the dark
See the light, forgеt your worries
What you know about?
This wasn't my fault
Y'all let the dеvil inside me wildin’
One milli' rent, all for my soul
Taking it back, now I'm back with nothing
I’m done with twisting my way, goddamn
Back‘ fore I was someone
Balka now let me speak
Laying new bricks on my realm right now
What you know about? 
I'm back on the rags and the risks
With the hands on my sauce
Independent I’m made to be free
I done paid time for their sins
It wasn’t that easy
No, it wasn’t a chance
They had me like
Wow, wow, wow, wow
Roll around, roll around late night
What have you done to my soul?
Killing it for the money, and now my mind left on the road
Roll around, roll around still fight
Now my demons getting tall
Am I supposed to relieve?
When at the end, it won’t be over
I thought that paper was a sort of price
For all the struggles I had before
Maybe was too young to get it right
But shit, I cannot let this go
Ok, back to reality, with tactics
Started the challenge again to get out sooner
They really want to keep a deal
I move quick, and called my lawyers
On the 26th I gotta cut through it
I never lied as much as on the TV, and never thought I’d deal with such a bad team
But it’s ok, I got my shit together
Type of lesson I am never forgetting, in fact I face few
Time throwing, slick talking
Dealing the shady people on the regular
Same stories, bad knowledge
2021 it’s over, take it as a sign
I’m packing back to my city
Watch me do it 10 times better walking in my scheme
Independent is the best deal, reminding 2016
Get the loop and restart itEy, yey
What you get is what you're giving
Amazigh
and I'm a freeman
I don’t need to fit in
Realest moving solo
Got it from my baba
I’m a freeman 'case you don’t know
Break if I don’t get in
Bless if I go loco
Praying isn’t easy when there’s blood left on the rental
Patience never lagging
Riches keep em coming
Milli from a jpeg
While you eating on an advance
How come is you fallin'?
How much is your balance?
How you get to motivate, just pick a pen and run it
Bitch, I got that since young
Bigger thinking, feeling strong
Belligerent on the front
Stamina when you bitch want
Fuck a spot, I’m on a terrain
I don’t play to fit a class
Neither pass to fit them boxеs
Bitch my path feels like a classic
I don’t need to fit in
Realest moving solo
Got it from my baba
I’m a freeman 'casе you don't know
Break if I don’t get in
Bless if I go loco
Praying isn’t easy when there’s blood left on the rentalHimalaya, my desire
Himalaya, dangerous as fire
Himalaya, Gods worship her
Himalaya, she ran over
Himalaya, smooth as my pain
Himalaya, scorches the rain
Himalaya, graciously you maim
Himalaya, pussy from Wayne
Himalaya, abstract as your dogma
Himalaya, shooting down the tiger
Himalaya, love is just a drama
Himalaya, love is just a trauma
I which I didn't look at you
You, Medusa
I which I didn't look at you
Poisonous Shiva
Himalaya, abstract as your dogma
Himalaya, shooting down the tiger
Himalaya, love is just a drama
Himalaya, love is just a trauma
Eyes made of diamonds
Mouth californium
Cheeks taaffeite
But you face is just painite
All these sparks I've ever seen, you're the one
I can't incur
All these charms hailing from your body, so rare
But I can't bear
Himalaya, abstract as your dogma
Himalaya, shooting down the tiger
Himalaya, love is just a drama
Himalaya, love is just a traumaSick fuck
Why you walking here?
There’s a thousand motherfucks’ like
Ready to jump on your seat, stop
Is you walking here?
Better run, get up or die in it
Slack in this bitch like I’m still at the top
Everybody knows my style and my name
Been on the road but my pace on a walk
I better wake the fuck up ‘fore I’m sitting on my comfort
I swear to god, shake me up
3ein in the spotlight jeez, what the fuck am I doing?
Just a sign bro, oh my god
I don’t need guidance, but a knock out in my head
Sick fuck
Why you walking here?
There’s a thousand motherfucks’ like
Ready to jump on your seat, stop
Is you walking here?
Better run, get up or die in it
Hey, I walk it, I talk it
Ain’t no rest unless it changes
I did the math I might not live that long, hey
I chop it, I bounce it, then I bring my ass on stage
I’m talking  50k a minimum
Quit texting, lightskins
Focus and work
Do not stop believing luck
Keep fronting, patience
Peace ain’t enough, never forget how to run
Sick fuck
Why you walking here?
There’s a thousand motherfucks’ like
Ready to jump on your seat, stop
Is you walking here?
Better run, get up or die in itRun
Get the fuck-
Never stoppin ever since I’m in the race
Speak facts, can’t afford a cheaper talk
I’m reaching for the highest, deep inside of me
That power never lied to me
I’m sipping from the source code
I pass by demons on a daily basis
And bypass bitches from the crowd noise
I can’t die, if I wanna fast life
Bellek on my hindsight, figure it out
Hands in the air, guns in the pants, down low
Hagar a jinx, aim at the head, moro
Raising the vibe, waves on a crescendo
Roll up your sleeves or 
All for the win, kick it or keep drowning
Step in the real life isn’t bout scaping
Trophies or deeds on my mind
I’m on peak, shit is tough
So I is on my life, I'ma
Get down or sit down
Get big or stay mad
Losing hope but there’s a seed now
Wake the fuck up, shit is real out
Get down or sit down
Get big or stay mad
Losing hope but there’s a seed now
Get up for the realm now
Shit is really real out
It’s all the head now, no matter what
You gotta keep the vibe going, and use your mind
Can’t stop right there
Can’t fail me now
I’m starving, more wins
I won’t stop shit
Won’t stop, started from a futon
Done break down, that shit was like a new stunt
Keep taxing, I’m mary poppin’ my bag
Still want me dead
Can’t stop, it’s clocking like a Richard
Brick mental, we talking ‘bout a Ming wall
I kill a prey
Praise the lord
Face the jinx
To fix the s3ol
A3oudoubillahYou sat on my mind
For a great amount of time
You ran on my soul
For the longest I didn't know
I've been planting seeds in my head
Before the shine and all
Though I really tried to forget
I can't escape the call
You sat on my mind
For a great amount of time
You ran on my soul
For the longest I didn't know
It's my fate
It's my chance
It's my paint
I cannot backpedal
It was written
Not up there
But by my hands
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the love
Now I gotta go
I love you so
Sorry, I'm so sorry
Sorry, I'm so sorryPut some respect on my name lil bitch, shit is over now
I don’t wanna know who’s right in this, just take my name out
Of you mouth, I know you proud we did it
Well, it was wild
Ever since we cut the ties you
Trashing, talking, gossip, lies
Attention, gave way you too much attention
Loving ain’t lies, attracted
All this time you went spazzing
Now the city knows that
Lil bitch, lil bitch, lil bitch
Coming back, talking down on me
Lil bitch, lil bitch, lil bitch
We used to make love
Lil bitch, lil bitch, lil bitch
Coming back, talking down on me
Lil bitch, lil bitch, lil bitch
We used to make love
Everybody know my name
La fama is a prick, how ‘bout you?
Crazy bitches creep these days
Hunhun, hunhun, hunhun
Too turned up on punanis
Big big cum sex tsunami
Time wasted on your body
Du lundi au lundi
, I was all about it 
You knеw a part of my self  
I ain’t thе same anymore 
Maybe just a little bit
Attention, gave way you too much attention
Loving ain’t lies, attracted
All this time you went spazzing
Your pride inLocked up in this bitch like Mandela
Twenty-four seven mad stress
Talking to myself, and the man in the mirror
On a mission, scratching back my walls
Burning more sage than fatties
Getting back pain from duties
Giving two fucks ‘bout my daily routine
Do not push me to the edge, oh lord
But let me go crazy
J’pète ma tete, mon crâne bitch
Let me go crazy
I’m trying not to fuck my life up but
Let me go crazy
I start feeling a little bit of psycho
So let me go crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
I went from rags to the riches to rags again
Shit getting harder, so life is
One of a kind never poppin, I spare my pain
I cannot spend it, I’m stacking
Bitch go dumb, but complaints don’t pay
I can save myself on my own
It ain’t madness if it’s my stress
I ain’t trippin if it’s my zone
Get it for the love, as I made my business
Sleeping on the console, I don’t count no more
Feeling kinda same, as if it was first season
Talking to myself, as if I expect God
I need more bizz, need more retention
Need more winnings, far less emotions
I cannot focus, I’m losing focus
Getting my strengh when I talk on my own
So let me go crazy
J’pète ma tete, mon crâne bitch
Let me go crazy
I’m trying not to fuck my life up but
Let me go crazy
I start feeling a little bit of psycho
So let me go crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazyStop wondering and just go
Smoke but will not stoned
Bitch believing in my soul
If she wasn't there I would've probably been gone
I been drowning
Cuban dolls, sins
I been going down
I been runnin-
Side my mind and
I found nothing bright
I feel better when I'm home
It feels like I wanna live forever
Threw my balance in the jungle
Pray for me if I ain't getting better
So keep on, keep on running
Keep on running 'gainst the choppa choppa
Keep on, keep on running
Keep on running till you finally find it
Your trick's feeling like a déjà vu
 was nobody's friend until I blew
Fake promises, bless me with the truth
Industry repeats its bullshit too
I need lotta space
Block your textos
Sorry miss
Don't want your fat ass
In my bedroom
Wait downstairs, oh
Back at it again
Going through my head
Nah, it won't leave
‘less I take a pill
Or I hit the gym x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
I ain't got time for your pussies
Time for them hoes
Even if I love the way you dance
I keep my circle close
Ain't no time for the critics
Tired of it all
Went from most loved to most hated without moving out of home
But fuck, I'm moving overseas
2018, NYC
They've been making fun of me
While I got meetings with JB
Getting out of my country
They were not ready for my shit
You want facts you gon' get them
So I'll be back with a Grammy
 x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
P
aris with my
brother So'
And we're meeting CEOs
Rilès international
Labels be blowing up my phone
Empire's starting to grow
Females come but never go
Reading contracts all night long
A hundred times just to make sure
Nobody's fooling the plan, imma write it my way
California this summer,
nah I don't pay the tickets
Alright, alright, it's all good, don't talk 'bout what's secret
Imma finish Rilèsundayz
then you gon see it
Silence and I were friends
Fireworks made us lose the bond
Darling I figured out
Peace wasn't made for me at all..
 x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?You, came back just for me
I was fine alone
Why won’t you let go ?
And you, was bad when we did it
When I felt so low, we never talked bout love
She misses coming at me
Secretly late at night
She miss my soft touch, honey
All night long
She need to feel that nasty
Unholly dirty vibe
That bitch be really crazy
Oh, she’s back
Baby kiss me more
Baby touch me right
Baby I’ll stay on it
All night long
Tell me what you want
I can do it twice
Ain’t got time for talking
All night long
She a freak, only kind of bad bitch
Easy fuckin, like a psychic
Watchout if she breaks down
Devilish, I don’t want her back, shit
Trifling, she don’t get the point
And now she bounces back
I did pray for bad bitches
Back then, then it was a spiral
These tornados never safe man
Now she run around town
Wanting to shag, you better hide your ass right 
Ouhh, Rilès
I know you wanna fuck
I bet your bitch cannot get wild like this
Like ouh, babe
I know you love lust
And my cherry taste better with time x2
Unexpected turn
That was an unexpected turn
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
Lately I’ve been in a rollercoaster mind
And my body cannot follow what’s inside
Will I still love me if I retire?
No, I’m not afraid to take the shot
No, I’m not afraid to say goodbye
Unexpected turn
That was an unexpected turn
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
And I’ve been thinking ‘bout it almost every night
I might sound so crazy ‘front of y’all
I’m looking for answers, I see none
So I guess it was written in Time
Next time’s probably gonna be the last
 x2
Unexpected turn
That was an unexpected turn
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m notRun motherfucker, run
Don't you slow down
No time for the past
When the present is doubt
Lotta shit to prove and looking behind is the trap
Oh the sand I see right now is only in my hourglass
Run motherfucker, run
Never slow down
No time for the past
When the present is doubt
Gotta lotta shit to do and looking behind is the trap
I was escaping the desert but they've been following my path
Oh
You won't bite me, nah
You can't bite me, nah
Got the
pungi
in my bag
Don't make me play for ya
Reality's not
Talking to you, why?
Maybe I'm stuck in the desert
Caught up in a mirage
Off of me
Off of me
Fuego at the tip of my fingers
Off of me
Off of me
Lately apples been looking handsome
Ohh ready for them rounds
Watch out on the ground
"Oh Lord.."
..he helped me too much
So I won't bother him
No more
Ready for them rounds
Watch out on the ground
Oh Lord
You helped me too much
Now I got snakes jumping on me
Save me now..
Solo but a lot
Embrace my skin, you won't bite my eyes
Next step is the dogs
Damn I brace myself against the wild
Nerves remain in place
Underneath my dirty mule head
Damages on my face
El hamdoulilah my mind:
SafeTurn up, turn up, turn up
Wait, wait, wait
2022 ‘til infinity
Speak my French no apology
I get more gains for the show stage
Don’t take a pic when I lift weight!
It's not a kishta, it’s a KeepKey
Mark my words for the big pic
Walk my way out the misery
Broke with a part of me
No fap, more immunity
Wow, wow, wow, wow
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Wow, wow, wow, wow
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Woes done made me crazy
I Kundalini, day to day
Speak in facts or shut it
Respect my lossas or get checked
Double check
Triple check, check my status
Break ya neck
I’m what’s next
Level up, lift it, light weight 
‘Nowadays’ feels like light yеars
J’ai encore du taff, to get right damn 
Fuck thе odds, in my practice, fight it
Turn up a notch your bitch likes this
It’s 2022 now I can’t go back
Yea, Imma try to be on my highest calibration and I understood that
Should not give a fuck ‘bout nothing
I don’t play for the charts or the fakes and the rats
Inner fate, on the map
Gotta pay for the mob
Do not pray for the top
When they pay for the spot
Don’t care if you won’t get my stitches
Never mind if you just talk that talk
Effortlessly in a higher transition
Don’t mind if I think out my soul
Let ‘em know what’s going on
Put that new bid for the stunt
Cryptoflexin’ 101
What you want? She works a nine to five job, she knows she ain’t a kid no more
But she missing when her life was ‘bout the playground
And everything feels bitter now
She’s falling, you don’t wanna face it, neither wanna live that life
Every morning is a torment, but they need you to stay here
Kids don’t have to pay the price, everytime you’re going home
Hiding all the pain, living with it day and night, hoping that you got it wrong
When you tried to end it, tired of a life that you don’t know is...
Is golden
And when you shed tears late at night, they’re golden
I know it’s a trap in the dark, 'cuz you don’t see you’re golden
Everyone seems better when you don’t know you’re golden
Always keeping this in mind, even when it’s cold in
I heard you tried to do it twice
I heard you in the kitchen, talking low, back in Grade 9
What type of shit’s in your mind?
Is it the same as me? Are we the same? Is it the genes, right?
Worries, escaping, plan it, leave ‘em, do it 
I know you know the feelling, tried to make it real, but angels still on time above
Failing, regrets, think about it, giving in for loving, living 
You know, I know the feeling, tried to make it real too, then angels showed me you - didn't fall in
So you had to face it, and you kept on living that life
Every morning was a torment, we needed you to stay here
Kids don’t have to pay the price, every time you were back home
Hiding all the pain, living with it day and night, now you know you had it wrong
When you tried to end it, for another life, 'cuz mama you’re still...
You’re golden
And when you shed tears late at night, they’re golden
I know it’s a trap in the dark, 'cuz you don’t see you’re golden
Everyone seems better when you don’t know you’re golden
Always keeping this in mind, even when it’s cold inLet's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ah, ah
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ah, ah
Easy man makin’ them choices
Easy man getting that bread 
Back on my shit, I was lost
Back on my dick, on myself
Let’s go, let’s go, I'ma get pesos
I'ma stop crying my ass, switch to beast mode
I was waiting for a flip, it’s on me tho
Fuck how they’re feeling, I’m feeling tremendo
I’m back on my independence, I’m better when I’m producing
Fuck all these labels, fuck if you said “need to switch it”, my style remains undefeated
So I better walk on my own, gems in my zone
Get ’em alone, pray it never stops
See me with the glow through the songs, done with the moan
Down to my bones, bitch I’m back on track
Nothing but facts, watch me get in back to back
Watch bring in all the stacks, marvelous slaps
First gotta put some respect, my name means I never quit, bitch
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ah, ah
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Ah, ah
Easy man makin’ them choices
Easy man getting that bread
Back on my shit, I was lost
Back on my dick, on myself
Ouhh, I’ll never look back, I’m driving
My neck was hurting from past tense
Watching my hand when distracted, and I’m doing me like a porn scene
I cannot chill I got fidgets, and I cannot speak on strategies
No I cannot give any minute, except’ if you talking ‘bout digits, riches
Wow, shit, get more done
Don’t let the pain take over, wish me luck, jeez
Thirthy-two more, and I'ma feel much better
Get more Ms, upside downs
Fuck your bank, get my stones
I don’t dance, I go dumb
I’m too brazy for the throne He don't give a fuck
He don't give a damn
Asaël N'guetta
let me introduce my friend
Aka '
Fucklalife
'
Cuz nothing bothers him
How many nights and evenings you spent smoking and drinking?
Oh, looking dumb right now
Take a sip or take a drag
Oh no stress now, hun
Azaza in every party
Every night another story
That nigga's a laboratory, but
A bit afraid for ya
I wish what happened to me never falls on ya, nah
Remember when I stressed out
I asked you how you don't mind about anything
You simply told me to
"Fucklalife my nigga"
What you mean?
"Fucklalife my nigga"
Just like you're doing?
"Fucklalife my nigga"
Ok ok..
"Fucklalife my nigga"
He told me to
"Fucklalife my nigga"
What you mean?
"Fucklalife my nigga"
Just like you're doing?
"Fucklalife my nigga"
Aza aza
"Fucklalife my nigga"
They won't understand
Making hits easily only for the fam'
I know you remember now
Faded at this party I told you I wrote a song about you saying..
Oh, looking rash right now
Many sips and many drags he wasted now, hun
Azaza in every party
Every night another story
That nigga's a cemetery, but
That's why we love ya
The craziest motherfuck' in the city for sure
Remember when I stressed out
I asked you how you don't mind about anything
You simply told me toI really tryna be my best now
Came back to where it started
Awaiting for the better days now
Only as long as you’re there
I never really said I’m sorry
Cuz I thought it’d make me stronger
I never really say I’m worried
I just keep that for my own
Only on lonely nights
I’m wandering around
In rounds still fight
Demons on my own
On lonely nights
Wandering round and round
Slowly, on the run
When I smoke and I drink
With the hoes and the cheers
It’s to feel more than I’m blank
I don’t know what is in deep inside
Yet I’m keeping the best part for myself
Would you still love me if I tell you my worst
My baby would you think about us?
Or am I tripping on my own? 
Would lie to me if I told you shit that I never said to no one?
Or am I trippin again alone?
Only on lonely nights
I’m wandering around
In rounds still fight
Demons on my own
On lonely nights
Wandering round and round
Slowly, on the run
Can you kill petty vibes, bring pretty lights
Pick feelings right, ease on my side
Make living worth it just for the night
When I’m on my worst behavior?
Fallin’ again is regular
Fillin’ the stress on paper
Getting up as a hustle
Shit I do when on my own
So won’t you be by my side a little bit
I’ll show you what’s under my skin
Killing the time while enjoying the ride
And not worry about what is goneAfter the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake

Lotta shit to live
And lotta rules to break
Lotta ass to smack
Lotta tits to grab
Lotta motherfuckers still be sleeping on my craft and..
I'M TOO BUSY GOT NO TIME
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK IS SO WRONG WITH
NIGGAS FIGHTING FOR THE CROWN
WHILE I BE LOOKIN' AT THEM FROM THE THRONE
Sak pasé? Sak pasé?
Lately my life's been a challenge
So pardon my French if I don't give a fuck 'bout your feelings
I told you last week what you hear, I did it all alone
Let me tell next week I'll release a hella video
I'm still editing the footage I can't trust no one
I tried to let them niggas do it, that shit was not fine
So listen bro when I tell you I'm running out of time
Look at me my nigga I can't even finish my lin..

Hold on, Hold on
Many talk but who got their shit done?
Got a mom and a sis' to  watch over
Plus I got a job
Habibi, habibi
I don't let love in the plan
I made a lotta mistakes before
Me try not do them again
Rilèsundayz 'bout to blow up yeah they feel the storm
Solo, solo working it, solo getting coins
Droppin' a deuce on the game as they sleep on my songs
Zerma
you said you don't know me but I'm all on your phoneI try to be on my highest self
Demons and satan, they know me well
Speak to myself when I gotta think
'Cause deep in my head I’m just talking shit
My living standard is kinda cheap
Bedroom too tiny it’s hard to breathe
I don’t live a lot 'cause I’m stuck in it
Yet imma talk ‘bout it, solo I’m infinite
On God 
I’m 'bout to, I’m ‘bout to be at the top of my world
Look at the shit that I’m serving, nobody does it
On God 
I got to, pull up and die for my dreams
Am I a man or a King?
I’ll do my thing, I said it, on God
I spend my days and my nights wondering if I should’ve just stopped it
Cannot remember when was the time I wasn’t lost
I’m spending most of my time going nowhere, guess this how I madе it
Drifting away, riding the waves, go with the flow
Forgеt the matrix, I reset the program, fuck up the script
Genghis Khan, for the type beat
Nose, for the type of bleed
Mode, I’m about to beast
King, been my type of shit
Still me against myself
'Cause real enemies, they faint
I know what’s happening, I’m not evolving, just elevating
On God 
I’m 'bout to, I’m ‘bout to be at the top of my world
Look at the shit that I’m serving, nobody does it
On God 
I got to, pull up and die for my dreams
Am I a man or a King?
I’ll do my thing, I said it, on God
On God 
I’m 'bout to, I’m ‘bout to be at the top of my world
Look at the shit that I’m serving, nobody does it
On God 
I got to, pull up and die for my dreams
Am I a man or a King?
I’ll do my thing, I said it, on God
